Tinkering with the tinkerbot

Hiya all!

Gwen here, just getting into this whole programming game. 
I've been studying a bit of code here or there. 
Now I would just like to learn how to apply it and learn more. 
I enjoy video games (so unique), backpacking, cooking as well as the little things in life. 
If there is someone literally hugging a tree, it is probably me.
